    "# Drill: Regression or classification\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the following situations, decide if you would model using a regression or classification model. Discuss your reasoning with your mentor next time you meet.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 months.<br>\n",
    "    Regression, because the output is a continous variable. <br>\n",
    "2. What color car someone is going to buy. <br>\n",
    "    Classification, because the output variable is catgeory(\"dark\",\"light\" or \"black\",\"blue\" etc.)<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. How many children a family will have.<br>\n",
    "    Both regression and classification make sense.Regression might give one float as a result (eg. 1.7). Whereas; classification might give a probaility of 37% for 1 kid and 60% for 2 kids.<bt>\n",
    "4. If someone will sign up for a service.<br>\n",
    "    The way the question is phrased, this askes for clasification (will sign up or won't).If the question would be, with what probability a client will sign up, then regression would be more appropriate.<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. The number of times someone will get sick in a year.<br>\n",
    "    I would use regression, because a float output makes a lot of sense. A probability of 2.3 times makes a lot of sense.Classfication would certainly work as well.<br>\n",
    "5. The probability someone will get sick in the next month.<br>\n",
    "    Because the question askes for a probability,  I would use regression.<br>\n",
    "6. Which medicine will work best for a given patient.<br>\n",
    "    I would use classification here, because treatments can easily be groupe into categorical variables. <br>"
